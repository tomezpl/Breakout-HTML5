# Breakout-HTML5
## A simple Breakout game written in HTML5
This is a Breakout-like game I made for a college assignment. Beware that the physics in the game are very basic.

The game itself uses HTML5, JavaScript (including classes!) and CSS3. [You can play the live demo here](https://rawgit.com/tomezpl/Breakout-HTML5/master/demo/demo_menu.html).
